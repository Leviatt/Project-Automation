For production environments, this solution can be scaled as follows:

* **Modular FB Design**: implement each conveyor, clamp, and arm as a reusable Function Block (FB). New stations can be added simply by instantiating FBs without modifying the core logic.

* **Diagnostics Expansion**: include alarm IDs, error codes, and retry logic. Store alarms in a buffer for history, allowing operators and maintenance teams to track and resolve recurring issues.

* **HMI Integration**: provide operator screens for start/stop, alarm acknowledgment, counters, and maintenance modes. This improves usability and transparency for production staff.

* **Networking**: connect to higher-level systems (SCADA/MES) using OPC UA or Profinet to share production metrics, alarms, and performance data.

* **Safety Integration**: incorporate a safety PLC or safe I/O modules for handling emergency stops, light curtains, and door interlocks. This ensures compliance with industrial safety standards.

* **System Scalability**: extend the line with additional conveyors, clamps, or robotic arms by instantiating more FBs. The FSM approach ensures that logic remains consistent and modular even as complexity grows.
